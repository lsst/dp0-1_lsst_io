.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
	- If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name"  -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _DP0-Delegate-Resources-DP0-Delegate-Homepage:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

DP0 Delegate Homepage

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

This page includes the guidelines, resources, and activities for DP0 Delegates.

**"DP0 delegate"** is the term for the 300 scientists and students who will have accounts in the Rubin Science Platform (RSP) at the Interim Data Facility (IDF) during Data Preview 0 (DP0). This term has been adopted to reflect DP0 participants’ important roles of representing the broad science community as learners, testers, and providers of feedback, and of sharing the benefits of their DP0 participation with their communities as teachers and colleagues. Delegates’ DP0-related activities will be supported with resources and infrastructure (as described below). The simulated data set being used for DP0 was created by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) as part of their second Data Challenge (DC2). 

| **Delegate Action Items Checklist**
| 1. Get one of the `RSP Accounts`_ for DP0 delegates.
| 2. Set up your account in the `Rubin Community Forum`_.
| 3. Attend one of the `DP0 Kick-Off Info Sessions`_.
| 4. Review the `Guidelines and Expectations`_ for delegates.
| 5. Consider participating in the `DP0 Delegate Assemblies`_.
| 6. Learn about `Getting Support`_ for DP0. 


.. Review content in <https://confluence.lsstcorp.org/display/LSSTOps/DP0+CE+Planning>__ for content and structure.



.. _Delegate-Homepage-RSP-Accounts:

RSP Accounts
============

**Activation:** Delegates will be contacted by Rubin staff to provide their `GitHub <http://www.github.com/>`_ username. They will then be invited to join the ``rubin-dp0`` GitHub Organization, and upon accepting the invitiation, will be able to log into the RSP at the IDF at `<http://data.lsst.cloud>`_. 

**Policies:** RSP accounts are not transferrable and delegates must not share their password with others. DP0 delegates are being given access to a *shared-risk developmental version* of the Rubin Science Platform and the accompanying documentation. **Everyone is responsible for their own safe usage of the RSP** and must be familiar with this list of :ref:`Data-Access-Analysis-Tools-RSP-Warnings`, and review the `Guidelines and Expectations`_ for DP0 delegates.

**Deactivation:** Delegates who are no longer using their accounts and would like to relinquish it to make way for others should please submit a GitHub issue in the ``rubin-dp0`` GitHub Organization to let us know, and then leave the ``rubin-dp0`` GitHub Organization. (Log into GitHub, navitate to `<https://github.com/settings/organizations>`_, and click on the "Leave" button for the ``rubin-dp0`` Organization.)

**For delegates who need to get a GitHub account:** go to `<http://www.github.com>`_ and select “sign up” in the upper right corner. For participation in DP0 it is not necessary to learn how to use git as a version control system, nor any of the git workflows or command line tools. GitHub will not be used for RSP accounts during Rubin Operations, this is a DP0-specific implementation.


Rubin Community Forum
=====================

The `Rubin Community Forum <http://community.lsst.org>`_ is the central hub for all virtual discussions and support. It is the best place to post your questions about anything and everything related to DP0.

**Accounts:** Go to `<http://community.lsst.org>`_ and use the "sign up" button at upper right to create an account (unless you have one already).

**Join the DP0 Delegates Group:** Go to `<https://community.lsst.org/groups>`_ and join "DP0 Delegates". This will ensure you have access to the the "Support -- DP0 RSP Services Issues" **(PLACEHOLDER for a link)** category.

| **Find DP0-Related Content and Discussions:**
| 1. `Support - Data Preview 0 <https://community.lsst.org/c/support/dp0>`_: for all questions and discussions related to DP0. For example, use of the RSP's aspects for science, contents of the DC2 data set, delegate activities, brainstorm new investigations, show-and-tell DP0-related results, etc.
| 2. "Support - DP0 RSP Services Issues" **(PLACEHOLDER for a link)**: technical Q&A and discussion about potential bugs, service outages, etc.
| 3. All topics in any category that are `tagged with #dp0 <https://community.lsst.org/tag/dp0>`_. 



DP0 Kick-Off Info Sessions

DP0 Delegate Assemblies
=======================

Virtual meetings that occur biweekly on Fridays from 9am to 11am Pacific time (alternating with `Stack Club`_) for DP0 delegates from North and South America and Europe, plus a `Third Thursday Office Hour`_ for live interaction for DP0 delegates from timezones in Australia and Asia (but all are welcome to attend this session).

**Connection Info:**  **(PLACEHOLDER for a link to connection info)**

All are welcome to attend these assemblies, as they are not restricted to delegates. All are welcome to join for only the first or second hour, or both hours.

| **First hour: a "formal" presentation with Q&A**, such as:
|   -- demonstrations and tutorials by Rubin staff
|   -- presentations from delegates about their DP0 work
| **Second hour: breakout sessions for discussion**, such as:
|   -- grassroots DP0 science working groups and collaborative projects
|   -- in-depth discussion related to the first hour's contents
|   -- "office hours" for Q&A with Rubin staff

Third Thursday Office Hour
--------------------------

A DP0 office hour aimed to be "time-zone - friendly" for the Australia and Asia - based delegates will be on the third Thursday of every month at 8am Tokyo / 9am Sydney (e.g., Wed 4pm in US Pacific Daylight Time). This will be open time for DP0 delegates to drop in, discuss their DP0-related activities with Rubin staff and with each other, and get support if needed.

Stack Club
----------

`Stack Club <https://github.com/LSSTScienceCollaborations/StackClub>`_ is a group of LSST Science Collaboration members committed to learning how to use the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines (colloquially called "the Stack"). The idea is that the best way to learn something is to try and teach it, and so they work collectively on creating useful tutorials featuring the Stack. Many of the `DP0 Delegate Assemblies`_ presentations will be based on tutorials developed by the Stack Club. On alternating Fridays, Stack Club meets for an open hack session. Stack Club members use the NCSA implementation of the RSP, where they also have access to the DC2 data set.

DP0 delegates are welcome to join one or more `Science Collaborations <https://www.lsstcorporation.org/science-collaborations>`_ and to join the Friday Stack Club Zoom sessions. (DP0 delegates do not need to formally join Stack Club unless they want to contribute to Stack Club tutorial notebooks). Stack Club meetings start with a roundtable of what people want to do or learn that day, and then work proceeds as people stay connected via Zoom, with the occasional question or discussion happening. Sometimes breakout rooms are used to discuss emergent topics. Often times Rubin Data Management staff join to provide support.  (NOTE WE NEED TO MENTION THAT THE DELEGATES WILL NOT AUTOMATICLLY GET AN NCSA ACCT BUT THEY CAN STILL LISTEN-IN AND WORK ON THEIR OWN NOTEBOOKS AT THE IDF).).

.. _Delegate-Homepage-Guidelines-Expectations:

Guidelines and Expectations
===========================

**Understand the shared-risk basis of DP0 RSP use.** Delegates are responsible for their own safe usage of the RSP and must be familiar with this list of :ref:`Data-Access-Analysis-Tools-RSP-Warnings`

**Abide by the code of conduct.** All delegates are expected to abide by the `LSST Communications Code of Conduct <https://docushare.lsstcorp.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-24920/>`_.

**Use appropriate acknowledgements and citations.** If you publish work enabled by DP0, the RSP, and/or the DESC's DC2 data set, please include: "CosmoDC2: A Synthetic Sky Catalog for Dark Energy Science with LSST" `Korytov et al (2019) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..245...26K/abstract>`_, “The LSST DESC DC2 Simulated Sky Survey” (`arXiv:2010.05926 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05926>`_), and potentially “DESC DC2 Data Release Note” (`arXiv:2101.04855 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04855>`_), especially if you used the Object or Truth-Match tables presented in that release note. **(PLACEHOLDER for additional papers and acknowledgments).**

**Choose a delegate activity.** Delegates are invited to take on an activity that helps to maximize the impact of DP0 with respect to the DP0 goals of testing and informing development of the RSP and preparing the scientific community to do LSST science. See `Suggested Delegate Activities`_. 

**Interact with your co-delegates.** Participate in the `Rubin Community Forum`_ and join the biweekly `DP0 Delegate Assemblies`_ as often as you can.

**Use your RSP account!** As there are a limited number of RSP accounts for DP0, please try to make some use of your account and learn to use at least one aspect of the RSP. There is no minimum time that you're expected to spend on DP0. If you find that you are done with DP0, consider relinquishing your account so it can be offered to someone else.

Getting Support
===============

**GitHub Issues:** **(PLACEHOLDER for a link and instructions and example)**

**Rubin Community Forum:** Post new topics in the `Data Preview 0 <https://community.lsst.org/c/support/dp0>`_ category for all questions related to DP0 science, i.e., the application of the LSST science pipelines or the RSP's analysis tools to the DC2 data set. Post new topics in the "DP0 RSP Services Issues" **(PLACEHOLDER for a link)** for minor questions related to RSP service or access issues (but please do not hesitate to submit GitHub issues).

**Live Support:** Bring your questions to the Friday delegate assemblies, third Thursday office hours, or Stack Club meetings and perhaps someone there will be able to assist you.
